<Info description="This example project can be used as a reference design to get started with designing Lithium-Ion Battery Management System (BMS) with MATLAB and Simulink.&#10;&#10;Project includes Simulink models for BMS Algorithms such as:&#10;&#10;1. State of Charge estimation using Extended Kalman Filter, Unscented Kalman Filter&#10;2. Passive Battery Cell Balancing&#10;3. State Machine for Pre-charging and Contactor Management&#10;4. Fault Management - Over/Under Voltage, Over Current, Over Temperature etc.&#10;5. Charge and Discharge Current Limit Calculations&#10;&#10;To design and test these algorithms, project also includes files for&#10;1. Li-ion Battery Cell Parameter Estimation&#10;2. Battery Pack with 6 cells in series and 96 cells in series&#10;3. Simulink Test files with test cases to test State Machine Logic"/>
